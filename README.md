# Flight-Delays-and-Cancellations
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. We can find the dataset in supporting materials at the bottom of this page.

The file we will use in creating our data visualizations is the flights.csv file. The other two provided files may be used in conjunction with the flights.csv file, but should not be used alone.

We are required to create three or more visualizations and then derieve details or story from it to describe the results to others.
